YDLIDAR OS30A 3D vision sensor:
Binocular Structured Light 3D Imaging Technology:

Binocular structured light 3D imaging technology is a method for capturing three-dimensional information of objects or scenes using a combination of binocular vision and structured light projection. This technology is widely used in fields such as computer vision, robotics, industrial automation, and augmented reality, among others. Here's how it works:

Binocular Vision: Binocular vision involves using two cameras or sensors, positioned similarly to the human eyes, to capture images from slightly different viewpoints. This mimics the way humans perceive depth by comparing the disparities between the images seen by each eye.

Structured Light Projection: Structured light involves projecting a known pattern, often a grid of light or a series of coded patterns, onto the object or scene. These patterns create light and dark areas on the object's surface.
Detection distance: 20-250 cm. It is dust and water proof. 

How lidar detection works?
It generates multimodal distribution 3D prediction boxes for each point in the point cloud. The moving points in the point cloud are detected, and the distance between several points is measured. Points that are close to each other are clustered into one object.
